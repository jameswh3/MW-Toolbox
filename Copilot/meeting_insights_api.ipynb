    "# Microsoft Graph Meeting Insights API Interaction (Delegated)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setup and Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to call the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve insights from a Teams meeting transcript using **delegated user permissions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Permissions Required\n",
    "Your Azure App Registration will need the following **delegated** permissions for this notebook to function correctly:\n",
    "- `User.Read`\n",
    "- `Calendars.Read`\n",
    "- `OnlineMeetings.Read`\n",
    "- `OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All`\n",
    "- `OnlineMeetingAiInsight.Read.All`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The `OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All` and `OnlineMeetingAiInsight.Read.All` permissions require administrator consent before they can be granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enable Public Client Flow\n",
    "For delegated authentication to work in this script, you must enable the public client flow in your App Registration:\n",
    "1. In your App Registration, go to the **Authentication** tab.\n",
    "2. Scroll down to **Advanced settings**.\n",
    "3. Set the toggle for **Allow public client flows** to **Yes**.\n",
    "4. Click **Save**.\n",
    "5. Ensure you also have a **Mobile and desktop applications** platform configured with a redirect URI for `http://localhost`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Variables\n",
    "This notebook uses a `.env` file in the root of the repository to load configuration. Make sure you have copied `.env-example` to `.env` and filled in the required values, especially:\n",
    "- `CopilotAPIPythonClient_Tenant`\n",
